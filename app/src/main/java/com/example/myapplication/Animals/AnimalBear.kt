Bears vary in size and behavior, but most have thick fur, strong claws, and an excellent sense of smell, which helps them locate food over long distances.\n" +

Their diet depends on the species and habitatâ€”while polar bears primarily hunt seals, brown bears and black bears eat berries, fish, small mammals, and honey. Some species, like the giant panda, rely almost entirely on bamboo.\n" +

Despite their large size, they can run fast, climb trees, and even swim well. Hibernation is another key feature of some bear species, such as the grizzly bear, which enters a deep sleep during winter to survive harsh conditions.\n" +

However, they face threats from habitat loss, climate change, and illegal hunting. Conservation efforts are crucial to protecting bear populations, especially species like the polar bear, which is endangered due to melting ice in the Arctic.\n" +
